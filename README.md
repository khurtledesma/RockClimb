Site built using django, python, html, css and jquery. 

I wanted to create a site that will let users keep track of outside routes they have climbed as well as include a way for users to find routes. Unfortunately, there are no available climbing API's out to the public at the moment so the results that come back from the route finder are all fake routes.
The site is modeled as if the user is already logged in.

User stories: 
As an avid climber, I want to be able to differentiate between the 2 main types of climbing routes outside so I can see my progress through each type of climb.
As an experienced climber, I want to be able to find new routes so that I can continue to challenge myself.
As a curious person, I want to be able to see what others are climbing so that I can see what their current projects are like.

Improvements:
1. Add a city verifier to the route finder search bar
2. Overall styling
3. Use my database to reutrn results when users search for climbs in a city
